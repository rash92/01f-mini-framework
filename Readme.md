TODO:
figure out how to get jsx syntax to work - example seems to have project started with create-react-app then edited, rather than e.g. liveserver. May want to figure out manual babel stuff.

alternatively to using babel, crate own functions to interpret jsx style components as strings into relevant objects.

figure out jest

make a server to be run from package.json with npm instead of live server?

continue on from step VII: function components
